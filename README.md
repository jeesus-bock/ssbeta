# SolidStart Beta

Experimentations and testing the beta tagged version of solid-start

## What has been done
1) Initialized project with npm init solid@next.
2) Changed the dependencies to beta versions. Solid-start and solid-start-node to beta and Vite -> 3 and Rollup -> 2.
3) Fixed Routes to FileRoutes in root.tsx.
4) Changed "context" to event in entry-server.tsx.
5) Added import of Routes from solid-app-router to root.tsx.
6) Wrapped FileRoutes inside <Routes></Routes> in root.tsx.

## Status

Seems to be working file like this. I'll keep the repo fresh when new versions pop.
